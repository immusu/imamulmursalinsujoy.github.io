        <h3>Monocular Camera Fusion for Enhanced Depth
          Sensing & Object Detection</h3>
          <p>
            <i>Supervisor: Dr. Md. Khalilur Rhaman, Professor, Department of CSE, BRAC University</i>
          </p>
        <p>In this era of technological advancement, autonomous vehicles strive towards 
          revolutionizing the transportation system. A critical challenge in this domain is 
          obstacle depth sensing in different environmental scenarios which is vital for 
          ensuring safety. This research paper proposes an innovative approach MiDYOLO. This 
          evolved approach is capable of addressing these challenges of obstacle depth sensing 
          by incorporating monocular camera fusion with a dynamic algorithm for accurate depth 
          detection and object identification. For detecting obstacles, autonomous vehicles rely 
          on an array of sensors, including a combination of LiDAR, Radar, and cameras each of 
          which has its strengths and limitations. Moreover, traditional modal systems combining 
          LiDAR or Radar with camera vision often have efficiency and cost related drawbacks such 
          as high cost or power demand and spatial resolution constraints. 
        </p>
          <p>
          Furthermore, Bangladesh's 
          road networks and challenging weather conditions makes the process more challenging. 
          In order to optimize obstacle depth sensing based on these diverse scenarios and dynamic 
          environmental conditions, our research proposes a concept with the fusion of monocular cameras 
          with merging algorithms. Building upon the capabilities of YOLOv7 serving the purpose of object 
          identification and Midas for accurate depth detection, MiDYOLO incorporates them in a seamless 
          way to create an approach that delivers enhanced depth perception and object categorization. 
          Alongside offering a promising trajectory for safer and more adaptive transportation in the 
          future, our proposed system  MiDYOLO ensures efficiency and accuracy in obstacle depth detection.

        <h3>Heart Disease Prediction System</h3>
              <p>
                The Heart Disease Prediction System is an innovative prototype designed to leverage Artificial Intelligence for predicting the 
                likelihood of heart disease in individuals. This system was developed as a comprehensive project, utilizing a historical dataset
                 of heart disease to train and validate various AI models. The core functionality of the system is based on multiple AI algorithms,
                  including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree classifiers. Each model was meticulously trained 
                  and tested on the dataset to evaluate their predictive accuracy and reliability. The dataset included a range of clinical parameters 
                  such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant health metrics. To develop this system, I first preprocessed 
                  the data to handle missing values, normalize features, and split the data into training and testing sets. I then implemented the KNN 
                  algorithm, which classifies a patient's condition based on the closest data points in the feature space. Next, I used the SVM model, 
                  which finds the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes of patients with and without heart disease. Finally, the Decision Tree 
                  model was implemented to create a tree-like structure of decisions based on the input features. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  After training the models, I conducted
                   a comprehensive comparison of their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This comparative 
                   analysis revealed the strengths and weaknesses of each model in predicting heart disease. Additionally, I implemented cross-validation
                    techniques to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the models. The Heart Disease Prediction System provides an interactive 
                    interface where users can input their health data and receive an immediate prediction of their heart disease risk. This prototype 
                    demonstrates the potential of AI in healthcare, offering a valuable tool for early diagnosis and preventive care.
