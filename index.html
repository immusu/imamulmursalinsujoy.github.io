              <h3>Space Survival Game</h3>
              <p>
                The Space Survival Game is an engaging arcade game developed as part of my computer graphics course, showcasing my proficiency 
                in game design and implementation using OpenGL and related libraries. In this game, players navigate a spaceship through space, 
                avoiding obstacles and enemies that become progressively more challenging over time. The core gameplay focuses on survival, 
                requiring quick reflexes and strategic maneuvers as the game difficulty increases. The project was developed on a robust platform, 
                utilizing OpenGL for rendering graphics, creating a visually appealing and smooth gaming experience. I employed various computer 
                graphics techniques such as texture mapping, lighting, and animations to enhance the visual aesthetics and realism of the game. 
                The game features a dynamically changing environment, with obstacles and enemies generated procedurally to ensure a unique and 
                unpredictable experience in each playthrough.
                In addition to the core mechanics, I implemented a user-friendly interface that includes score tracking, health indicators, 
                and intuitive controls, making the game accessible to players of all skill levels. The development process involved thorough 
                testing and optimization to ensure performance efficiency and a seamless gameplay experience.

              <h3>Heart Disease Prediction System</h3>
              <p>
                The Heart Disease Prediction System is an innovative prototype designed to leverage Artificial Intelligence for predicting the 
                likelihood of heart disease in individuals. This system was developed as a comprehensive project, utilizing a historical dataset
                 of heart disease to train and validate various AI models. The core functionality of the system is based on multiple AI algorithms,
                  including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree classifiers. Each model was meticulously trained 
                  and tested on the dataset to evaluate their predictive accuracy and reliability. The dataset included a range of clinical parameters 
                  such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant health metrics. To develop this system, I first preprocessed 
                  the data to handle missing values, normalize features, and split the data into training and testing sets. I then implemented the KNN 
                  algorithm, which classifies a patient's condition based on the closest data points in the feature space. Next, I used the SVM model, 
                  which finds the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes of patients with and without heart disease. Finally, the Decision Tree 
                  model was implemented to create a tree-like structure of decisions based on the input features. After training the models, I conducted
                   a comprehensive comparison of their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This comparative 
                   analysis revealed the strengths and weaknesses of each model in predicting heart disease. Additionally, I implemented cross-validation
                    techniques to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the models. The Heart Disease Prediction System provides an interactive 
                    interface where users can input their health data and receive an immediate prediction of their heart disease risk. This prototype 
                    demonstrates the potential of AI in healthcare, offering a valuable tool for early diagnosis and preventive care.

              <h3>Fire Detection System</h3>
              <p>
                The Fire Detection System is a comprehensive hardware prototype designed to enhance fire safety through early 
                detection and real-time alerts. The system employs a highly sensitive fire sensor, which promptly identifies 
                the presence of fire or smoke. Additionally, the MQ-02 gas sensor is integrated to detect combustible gases, 
                providing an extra layer of hazard detection. Upon detecting a fire or hazardous gas levels, the system leverages 
                the HC-05 Bluetooth module to transmit immediate hazard notifications to connected smartphones. This ensures that 
                users receive timely alerts, allowing for quick response and mitigation of potential fire-related damages. 
                The Bluetooth module's reliable communication capabilities facilitate seamless connectivity between the detection 
                system and the users' mobile devices. The project also involves programming microcontrollers to process sensor 
                data and manage the communication between sensors and smartphones. The system's design emphasizes ease of installation 
                and user-friendliness, making it suitable for various environments such as homes, offices, and industrial settings.

              <h3>Online Donation System</h3>
              <p>
                The system is divided into two main panels: the Admin Panel and the Donor Panel, each with distinct 
                functionalities tailored to their specific user roles. The Admin Panel allows administrators to manage 
                and oversee the donation process effectively. Admins can add, update, or delete donation campaigns, 
                track donation progress, and generate reports. This panel includes a dashboard that provides real-time 
                statistics and analytics, helping admins to monitor the overall performance and engagement of the platform. 
                Security features such as user authentication and role-based access control ensure that only authorized 
                personnel can perform administrative tasks. The Donor Panel is designed to provide a straightforward 
                and intuitive experience for donors. Donors can easily browse through various donation campaigns, select 
                causes they wish to support, and make donations securely. The panel includes features such as donation 
                history, recurring donations, and personalized thank-you messages. Donors can also create accounts to 
                manage their profiles and track their contributions over time. The platform is built with PHP, 
                leveraging its robust capabilities for dynamic content generation and database interaction. CSS is 
                used to style the application, ensuring a clean and visually appealing interface. Bootstrap is incorporated 
                to enhance responsiveness, allowing the system to function flawlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. 
                Additional features include secure payment processing, real-time notifications, and search functionality to help 
                users find specific campaigns quickly. The system also supports multiple payment gateways, ensuring flexibility 
                and convenience for donors.

              <h3>Digital Clock System</h3>
              <p>
                The core of the system is the 555 timer IC, configured to generate precise timing pulses. 
                These pulses are fed into the 7493 binary counter IC, which counts the pulses and translates 
                them into a binary format. The binary output from the 7493 IC is then decoded and displayed on 
                the seven-segment displays, representing the hours, minutes, and seconds in a 24-hour format. 
                This ensures accurate and readable time presentation. To enhance functionality, the Digital 
                Clock System includes a stopwatch mode, allowing users to measure elapsed time with precision. 
                By integrating control switches, users can start, stop, and reset the stopwatch as needed. This 
                dual functionality makes the system versatile and practical for various timekeeping needs. 
                The synchronization feature is another highlight of this project. The clock can be synchronized 
                with external clock frequencies, ensuring it remains accurate even when integrated into different 
                systems or environments. This capability is achieved through adjustable frequency dividers and 
                synchronization circuits, demonstrating the adaptability and precision of the design. During the 
                development process, careful attention was paid to the electrical design and circuit layout to 
                ensure stability and accuracy. The project involved soldering components, designing circuit 
                boards, and extensive testing to fine-tune the system's performance.
